# Online Pharmacy

## Introduction
Charmacy is a fully-functional, modern, and responsive online pharmacy platform developed to simplify access to essential medicines and healthcare products. The goal of this project is to provide users with a seamless and secure digital healthcare experience from the comfort of their homes.

This platform empowers users to search for medicines in real-time, manage their shopping cart, upload prescriptions, and place ordersâ€”all within an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. By integrating Firebase for authentication, database storage, and real-time data handling, Charmacy ensures both performance and data security.

Charmacy addresses key problems in the traditional pharmacy model by:

Offering 24/7 accessibility to medicines

Enabling real-time search and filtering for faster discovery

Allowing secure prescription uploads tied to user accounts

Managing cart and user session data effectively

Ensuring a smooth shopping experience across devices with a fully responsive UI

Whether for everyday health needs or ongoing treatment requirements, Charmacy bridges the gap between users and healthcare with convenience, personalization, and trust.
